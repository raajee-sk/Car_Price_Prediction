# CarDekho Used Car Price Prediction


## Problem Statement:

The primary objective of is project is to create a data science solution for predicting used car prices accurately by analyzing a diverse dataset including car model, no. of owners, age, mileage, fuel type, kilometers driven, features and location. The aim is to build a machine learning model that offers users to find current valuations for used cars.


### Libraries/Modules needed for the project!

- Pandas - (To Clean and maipulate the data)
- matplotlib, Seaborn - (To plot and visualize the data)
- streamlit

## Solution

The solution includes the following steps:

Uploading the given Dataset.

Exploring skewness and outliers in the dataset.

Transforming the data into a suitable format and performing any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.

Developing a machine learning regression model which predicts the continuous variable 'Car_Price' using the RandomForestRegressor which give the beter accuracy score.

Creating a Streamlit page where you can insert each column value and get the Predicted_Price of Car.


## Getting Started


Install the required libraries.

Run the Streamlit app using the command: streamlit run app.py.

Enter the values for each column to get the Predicted_Price of Car.
